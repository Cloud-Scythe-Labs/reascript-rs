> All types and functions are wrapped, meaning you won't need to use the `unsafe` keyword, 
however it is still important to note that they are technically `unsafe` under the hood.

`reascript-rs` makes it easier to follow the ReaScript API in Rust as if you were using one 
of the already supported languages, e.g. Lua, Python, etc. All naming conventions and inputs are 
untouched, and will be exactly as they appear in the official [ReaScript API documentation](https://www.reaper.fm/sdk/reascript/reascripthelp.html#c), 
allowing you to write your own higher level APIs as you see fit.

## Versioned Builds

Firstly, a special thanks to @helgoboss and other contributors to the `reaper-rs` project, which is the 
inspiration for `reascript-rs`.

`reascript-rs` aims to be backwards compatible with all previous versions of the ReaScript API.
To achieve this we re-create each release of the [open source C/C++ GitHub mirror](https://github.com/justinfrankel/WDL), 
made available by Cuckos, and auto-generate releases as new versions become available. This means that developers
or average users can write plugins, macros and scripts in Rust regardless of which version of REAPER they prefer, 
and that the Rust API will always be up-to-date with the official release. **Each release version will be the same 
as its corresponding ReaScript version, e.g. ReaScript v0.1.0 -> reascript.rs v0.1.0**

Our hope by doing this, is for Rust to be official adopted by the [ReaScript Supported Languages](https://www.cockos.com/reaper/sdk/reascript/reascript.php).
